excerpt: 'This manuscript reports the simultaneous purification and stable dispersion of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using a non-aromatic polymer ethyl cellulose (EC). Recent efforts have focused on the quality enhancement of mass-produced BNNTs as well as on the different strategies for the improvement of their dispersibility, to enable various practical applications. However, these known purification methods and dispersion strategies involve energy intensive heat treatment, and highly expensive, conjugated polymers, respectively. Here, we examine the versatility of a flexible, non-toxic, and non-aromatic EC to functionalize and disperse BNNTs in wide range of solvents. Our work reveals that EC can uniformly and selectively wrap the tubes forming a homogeneous colloidal dispersion of individualized BNNTs, stabilized by a suitable solvent. This can provide wider potential applications specifically for the fabrication of materials that requires large amount of high-quality BNNTs.'
