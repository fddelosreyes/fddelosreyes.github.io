excerpt: '<j>This research reports the simultaneous purification and stable dispersion of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using a non-aromatic polymer ethyl cellulose (EC). Recent efforts have focused on the quality enhancement of mass-produced BNNTs as well as on the different strategies for the improvement of their dispersibility, to enable various practical applications. However, these known purification methods and dispersion strategies involve energy intensive heat treatment, and highly expensive, conjugated polymers, respectively. Here, we examine the versatility of a flexible, non-toxic, and non-aromatic EC to functionalize and disperse BNNTs in wide range of solvents. Our work reveals that EC can uniformly and selectively wrap the tubes forming a homogeneous colloidal dispersion of individualized BNNTs, stabilized by a suitable solvent. This can provide wider potential applications specifically for the fabrication of materials that requires large amount of high-quality BNNTs.</j>'

<b>Abstract</b>. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are simultaneously isolated and dispersed in organic solvents using a non‐aromatic and highly flexible polymer ethyl cellulose (EC). The colloidal dispersion containing individualized EC‐wrapped BNNTs is stabilized via non‐covalent functionalization through CH‐π and OH‐π interactions between EC and BNNTs. FESEM, TEM, UV‐VIS, FT‐IR, and TG analyses confirm the efficiency of using a simplified and less destructive method without prior heat treatment to enhance the purity and dispersibility of BNNTs in our designed system. This provides a practical approach to the purification and dispersion of BNNTs from a bulk‐produced source, for the fabrication of materials that require large amount of high‐quality BNNTs.
